# PC code

Necessary code to run experiment and measurements

## Set up

You will need Python 3 (preferably 3.7) to run this code in Windows (currently not working on other platforms).

Execute the following in this same directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Docker
The current implementation does not support an integration with docker. As it has to interact with windows.

A future implementation will not require this and will be available for Ubuntu / MacOS.
